#sending email with python without logging into the email client.
#for example, app password will be created from gmail account and be used in the code (or app) that is being written below.
# an attacker use case is the attacker needs to only compromise your gmail password once and go inside to create this app password that he can 
# #now use anytime to send email from your gmail without physically logging into your gmail anymore. This could be used in BEC. So it is important to protect your
# gmail user/interactive password.
# Note that the app password mentioned above is like system password. The app or code applies it behind the scene, unlike an interactive user password.
